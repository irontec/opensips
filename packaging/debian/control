Description: very fast and configurable SIP server
 OpenSIPS is a very fast and flexible SIP (RFC3261)
 server. Written entirely in C, OpenSIPS can handle thousands calls
 per second even on low-budget hardware.

 behaviour. Its modular architecture allows only required functionality to be
 loaded.
 .
 Among others, the following modules are available: Digest Authentication, CPL
 scripts, Instant Messaging, MySQL support, Presence Agent, Radius
 Authentication, Record Routing, SMS Gateway, Jabber/XMPP Gateway, Transaction
 Module, Registrar and User Location, Load Balaning/Dispatching/LCR,
 XMLRPC Interface.
 .
